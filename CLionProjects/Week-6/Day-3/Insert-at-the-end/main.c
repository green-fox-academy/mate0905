// You will write a program that keeps track of exam results.
// First, your program should ask the user how many classes took the exam. Let's say this number is N.
// Then you need to ask how many students took the exam in the first class. Let's say this number is M.
// You need to ask for the name of the class, the the exam results in percentage M times and store them.
// The number of students might be different for each class.
// You need to repeat this N times.
// Make sure you have a separate function that reads the data and returns it.

// Once you have the data write functions for the following questions:
// Which class has the biggest difference between the worst and best exam and how much is the difference?
// Which class has the best exam?
// What is the average of all the exams?
